# Affinity analysis (basket analysis)
identifying the association of people who purchase one book and also purchase other books
The association is based on [principle of correlation](https://measuringu.com/predicting-r/) we use between continuous variables.

# Colleting and formatting the data


# Computing the correlation


# Conclusions
Here are a few things to remember about using an affinity analysis for your next project:

 - An affinity analysis is a mathematical way of understanding how two variables (usually binary) are associated.
 - Association between binary variables can be computed using the phi correlation from data set up in a contingency table.
 - The Pearson correlation is a shortcut for the phi and can be easily computed in Excel.
 - Phi correlation can be interpreted similarly to the Pearson correlation, with higher values indicating greater purchase affinity.
 - While correlation does not guarantee causation, it can help us predict behaviors.
